Future Scope:

The principal idea behind Industrial IoT is to make machines smarter and more efficient than human
counterparts by constantly collecting, analyzing, and acting upon data. IIoT is defined as “machines,
computers and people enabling intelligent industrial operations using advanced data analytics for
transformational business outcomes”. The IIoT in this sense can be considered a movement towards
‘smart machines’ whereby the accuracy levels of the operations involved in the respective systems
are heightened to a level that cannot be achieved through human interventions.
With companies now developing cutting-edge sensory technologies to capture data, the retrieved
data can be coupled with real-time predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to
get a better understanding of how machines and production lines are performing.Basically, AI and ML
programs are combined with IoT devices to give them proper automation. Due to this, IoT has also
expanded its area of application in most of the sectors.
